Catania2k25 ‚Äì Robotics Competition Project
Catania2k25 is a robotics control project developed for a robotics competition by high school student Pietro Reghenzi from Liceo Scientifico Statale Copernico.

This project uses a Raspberry Pi to control a robot via GPIO input, serial communication with an Arduino, and camera-based object detection. It includes state management, color recognition, and step-based logic to interact with physical components in a trial scenario.

If you would like to contribute or collaborate, please contact Pietro Reghenzi at pietro.reghenzi.jr@gmail.com.

üìÅ File Overview
main.py
This is the core control script for the robot.

Connects to the Arduino over a serial connection.

Coordinates a two-phase trial involving color detection and pickup tasks.

Uses camera input to detect car colors (BLUE_CAR, RED_CAR).

Controls logic through commands sent via serial, like TRIAL_BEGIN, PICK_UP, DROP_BLUE, etc.

Contains logic for:

Aligning the robot

Detecting and picking up blue cars

Dropping cars off at designated locations

Resetting the system

Implements multiple helper functions and a class CarHolder to manage collected car objects.

button.py
A utility script designed to launch the main control script when a physical switch (connected to GPIO17 on the Raspberry Pi) is turned ON.

Monitors a lever (switch) state via GPIO.

When switched ON, it activates a Python virtual environment and starts main.py.

Prevents repeated launches by waiting until the switch is turned OFF.
